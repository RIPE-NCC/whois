Test plan for whois-telnet services

[TP] create an input file using the qrylog files. They have the following format:
20141010 00:00:00   11111234 PW-QRY-INFO <2+2+0>  3ms [10.0.0.1] -- -T person test

To have the qry logs of a day as input: 
- combine the qrylogs for a whole day from all PRD servers
- optionally filter out the api and the BLOCKED queries

also
- add the shaded whois-db-version.jar in the jmeter lib folder
