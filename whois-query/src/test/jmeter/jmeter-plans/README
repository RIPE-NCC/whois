to run jmeter plans
- download jmeter
- unpack it
- ignore the startup scripts provided in the bin directory

In each jmeter plan's directory: 
- make sure that the .jmx file has the correct: 
  - input/output file names
  - server/port under test
- check again the thread number, loops, delays. best way to check these
    options is to open the .jmx file from the GUI  

- make sure that the run-xxxxx.sh script points to the correct locations for 
  - the jmeter jar file, 
  - the jmeter home dir (-d), 
  - the test plan (-t) 
  - the log files 
- execute the run script using screen.

- read the README in each test plan's directory for further instructions

Note that the output of the test run will be a CSV file with extension .jtl. It is different for
each plan and it can be visualised with jmeter itself or with logstash-elasticsearch-kibana.
