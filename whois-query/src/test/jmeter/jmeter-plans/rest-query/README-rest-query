Test plan for rest services

[TP] create an input file using the apache access logs. They have the following format:
10.0.0.1 rest.db.ripe.net - - [DATE TIME] "GET /search.json?query-string=XXXX HTTP/1.1" 200 6520 "-" "-"

To have the access logs of a day as input: 
- combine the ssl_access_log and the access_log from the httpd log directory of all PRD servers/proxies
- check the date of the log statements in the file so as to use the logs only of one full day.
- keep GET and HEAD requests
- if necessary prepend the request with /whois e.g. the above quoted request would be GET /whois/search.json?....
