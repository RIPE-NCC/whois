NAME
     Yacc - an LALR(1) parser generator

SYNOPSIS
     yacc [ -dlrtv ] [ -b _p_r_e_f_i_x ] _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e

DESCRIPTION
     _Y_a_c_c reads the grammar specification in  the  file  _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
     and  generates  an LR(1) parser for it.  The parsers consist
     of a set of LALR(1) parsing  tables  and  a  driver  routine
     written in the C programming language.  _Y_a_c_c normally writes
     the parse tables and the driver routine to the file _y._t_a_b._c.

     The following options are available:

          -b _p_r_e_f_i_x
               The -b option changes the prefix prepended to  the
               output file names to the string denoted by _p_r_e_f_i_x.
               The default prefix is the character _y.

          -d   The -d option causes the header file _y._t_a_b._h to be
               written.

          -l   If the -l  option  is  not  specified,  _y_a_c_c  will
               insert  #line  directives  in  the generated code.
               The #line directives let  the  C  compiler  relate
               errors  in the generated code to the user's origi-
               nal code.  If the -l  option  is  specified,  _y_a_c_c
               will  not  insert  the  #line  directives.   #line
               directives specified by the user will be retained.

          -r   The -r option  causes  _y_a_c_c  to  produce  separate
               files for code and tables.  The code file is named
               _y._c_o_d_e._c, and the tables file is named _y._t_a_b._c.

          -t   The -t option changes the preprocessor  directives
               generated  by  _y_a_c_c  so  that debugging statements
               will be incorporated in the compiled code.

          -v   The -v option causes a human-readable  description
               of  the generated parser to be written to the file
               _y._o_u_t_p_u_t.

     If the  environment  variable  TMPDIR  is  set,  the  string
     denoted  by TMPDIR will be used as the name of the directory
     where the temporary files are created.

DIAGNOSTICS
     If there are rules that are never  reduced,  the  number  of
     such  rules is reported on standard error.  If there are any
     LALR(1) conflicts, the number of conflicts  is  reported  on
     standard error.
